# esp32-touchscreen-home-assistant-panel

Using a https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7 v1.1 touchscreen to control home assistant devices in PlatformIO with Arduino

Issues:
I believe all of the issues are fixed. Requires further testing, but initial tests for about 10 minutes sees none of the below issues where the screen shifting was happening basically every button press before.
