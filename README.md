[Commit fbf03f54052caf640e248d55e45f4b4075559762](https://github.com/PockyBum522/esp32-touchscreen-home-assistant-panel/commit/15c504be1ab20fb5113068617bda0e418f509b81) is a good commit to start at if you just need to get the 7-inch LCD board running in PlatformIO


Issues:

NOTE: I believe all of the issues are fixed. Requires further testing, but initial tests for about 10 minutes sees none of the below issues where the screen shifting was happening basically every button press before.
