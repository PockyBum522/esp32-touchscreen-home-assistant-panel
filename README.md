# esp32-touchscreen-home-assistant-panel

Using a https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7 v1.1 touchscreen to send MQTT messages to control devices in PlatformIO with Arduino


Issues:
I believe all of the issues are fixed. Requires further testing, but initial tests for about 10 minutes sees none of the below issues where the screen shifting was happening basically every button press before. 

See:

if you're interested in a play-by-play of what I modified to fix the vertical screen shifting issue.
